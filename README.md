OMG, dude, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Dual, and I'm not even sure what to think right now. For real, what even was that ending? It’s like the writers were like, Let’s roll a dice and see what happens next, you know?

Sarah’s whole “I might die, so let’s clone myself” thing was wild from the start. My brain was like halfway between ‘this is sick’ and ‘what am I even 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 right now.’ Can you imagine just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the  , pressing play, and then BAM, you’re in this weird-ass rabbit hole of clone wars? 😂😂

> And then there was her clone, just casually taking over like it’s the most normal thing in the world. Like HELLO, earth to fictional world, that’s not how it’s supposed to work, okay? Haha, and the way people were just chill with it? Unreal. Honestly, at some point, I half-expected the clone to just break into song or something, coz why not, right?

Seriously though, I kept thinking, if I had a clone, would they be cooler than me? I’m like 70% sure they’d be way more organized, ha! Also, that part with the lawyer? I was just sitting there like, “Come on, dude, you’re messing with my head!” It made me think, maybe next time, I should just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a comedy, not this brain-bending sci-fi stuff.

By the way, totally random memory explosion: Remember when I 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   yesterday? Didn’t expect it to go zero to existential crisis so fast. One sec you’re chilling, next sec you’re questioning the meaning of identity. Thanks,  .

public int RandomFunction() { return 42; } // No clue why this came to mind, maybe I'm glitching like the plot did.

Anyway, if you haven’t seen it yet, grab some popcorn, maybe a clone of yourself for double the fun, and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . We can freak out together over the ending, lol. Still can't get over it!
